# Welcome to EISA-EXPOSOME

EISA-EXPOSOME platform for high throughput suspect chemical screening, which can help reduce the dependence on chemical standards in traditional chemical analysis and significantly enhance the chemical
coverage. This algorithm used a targeted peak extraction strategy to rescue features that cannot
be extracted by traditional peak extraction algorithms, improving the coverage of chemica  substance annotation.
### The workflow of EISA-EXPOSOME is as follows

# Database for EISA-EXPOSOME

If you are building your own database, your file (.xlsx /.csv) must contain the following columns:|NAME|PrecursorMZ|ProductMZ|Intensity|RT|ID|, **RT** is not essential. 
We also provide the compiled T3DB database file in .xlsx format.
|NAME|PrecursorMZ|ProductMZ|Intensity|RT|ID|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Methamidophos|142.0086|94.0046|100|2.182|1|
|Methamidophos|142.0086|124.9816|27|2.182|1|


# Shiny
We provide a Rshiny program for EISA-EXPOSOME, which runs with the interface shown below, and you can filter the results according to the visualisation interfaceÔºÅ
